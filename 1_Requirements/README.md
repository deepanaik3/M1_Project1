  # Who
  - Any person for the Caclulations.
  # What
  - This project idea is to find the multiplication of 2 integer.
  # Why
  - This project uses simple function it is very compact to work.
  # How
  - By implementing multilevel program it can be achived this project requires a lost cost of development.
